⚙️ Setup Instructions
1️⃣ Create Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate  # For Windows

2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Add Secret Config Files (Important 🔐)

Create backend/cloudinary_config.py

cloudinary_config = {
    "cloud_name": "XXXX",
    "api_key": "XXXX",
    "api_secret": "XXXX"
}


Create backend/firebase_config.py

import firebase_admin
from firebase_admin import credentials, firestore

cred = credentials.Certificate("serviceAccountKey.json")
firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred)

db = firestore.client()


Do NOT upload these files to GitHub.
(They're ignored in .gitignore)

🚀 Run Backend
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload
